## dbt SQL models for BigQuery <a name='sql'></a>
In my current role as the Associate Director of Analytics Engineering at KIPP Public Schools NorCal, one of my primary responsibilities is to build Tableau dashboards to support progress monitoring to goals for partner team initiatives. KIPP NorCal relies heavily on data to inform regional priorities and strategies, and there are strong goal-setting practices throughout the organization. As I partner with teams, I engage in thorough discovery work to understand their data-tracking needs, and then I design and build Tableau dashboards, as well as the underlying SQL data models, that allow the teams to easily track progress to all of their goals. I am not able to share the Tableau workbooks directly because of data privacy concerns, but the PDF screenshots I included below can give a rough idea of some of the data tools I build in my current role.

## d3.js <a name='d3'></a>
These samples are less recent, but I'm including them because d3.js was my portal to the world of analytics engineering. I fell in love with d3.js because it allowed me to be artsy and mathy and so very detailed all at once. I've come to terms with the impractical limits of building d3.js tools for the Data & Analytics teams that I've been a part of to date, but I will always hold a special place in my heart for the infinite customizability of d3.js. These visualizations may suffer from browser compatibility issues because of the time that has passed since I built them; please view these in Google Chrome.

| **Literacy in Dallas County** | [Visualization](https://amarinovic.github.io/analytics-portfolio/projects/earlyliteracy/index.html) | Only 36% of Dallas County 3rd grade students were reading proficiently in 2015, but a number of national studies identified 3rd grade reading proficiency as a key factor in determining the likelihood of a student's graduation from high school. This interactive visualization illustrates the impact of 3rd grade reading proficiency on Dallas County high school graduation rates and consequent lost earnings to the region. I created this visualization during a summer internship. |
| **National Assessment of Education Progress Trends** | [Visualization](https://amarinovic.github.io/analytics-portfolio/projects/naep/index.html)| The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the largest nationally representative and continuing assessment of what America's students know and can do in various academic subjects. I created this visualization on my own time to explore trends in 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics scores. Comparisons can be made over time, between states and cities, and among subgroups. |
